## [0.10.0] — 2026-07-01

Adds a Tizen build path and brings the desktop render output into parity with the A2UI
web composer. No public API changes.

### Added

- **Tizen / gbs build.** RPM packaging under `packaging/` (`a2ui-dali.spec`,
  `a2ui-dali.manifest`) builds a2ui-dali for Tizen with
  [gbs](https://docs.tizen.org/platform/reference/gbs/gbs-overview/), alongside the
  existing desktop CMake build. The package installs the example binaries and their
  runtime resources (`res/`, gallery `screens/`, `samples/`) under
  `/usr/share/a2ui-dali`; launch the examples from that data dir so the relative `res/`
  path resolves. See the README for pointing gbs at a DALi snapshot that matches the
  target device.

### Changed

- **Rendering parity with the A2UI web composer** — web-matched design tokens (spacing,
  radii, colours, font sizes) and full-width images so cards lay out like the reference
  composer.
- `CMakeLists.txt` applies the `$DESKTOP_PREFIX` link path only when it is set, so a
  single build script serves both the desktop (`dali-env`) and the gbs/RPM builds.

### Fixed

- Number and date value formatting in the `${…}` expression evaluator.
- Card bottom padding: DALi `FlexLayout` drops the bottom inset of a `WRAP_CONTENT`
  column, leaving every card one padding short — an explicit bottom spacer restores the
  symmetric inset.

### Compatibility

- Verified on a **Tizen 11 emulator (DALi 2.5.25)** via gbs and on the desktop `dali-env`
  build. a2ui-dali tracks the `dali-ui` `devel` API, so check out the `dali-ui` revision
  that matches your target's DALi version (this release was built against `dali-ui`
  `12b0de06`, DALi 2.5.25). Source `setenv` from your `dali-env` before the desktop build.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-12

Initial public release of **a2ui-dali**, a native C++/[DALi](https://github.com/dalihub)
renderer for the [A2UI v0.9](https://a2ui.org) protocol. It turns an A2UI message stream
into native DALi views: you feed it messages as they arrive, and it builds and
incrementally updates the UI, raises an event with the root view for each surface, and
reports user actions back to you.

**Status — 0.9 (pre-1.0).** The v0.9 catalog is feature-complete and rendering is
regression-tested, but the public API and theming are not yet frozen and the renderer
tracks a moving `dali-ui` `devel` API (see *Compatibility*). Expect breaking changes
before 1.0.

### Highlights

- **Full A2UI v0.9 catalog** rendered onto DALi — layout, text, media, inputs, lists,
  tabs, and a modal — with two-way data binding, `${…}` expression evaluation, list
  templating, and form validation (`checks`).
- **`A2uiHost` facade** — one object owns the surface registry, message parser, and
  renderer. Multi-surface routing by `surfaceId`, per-surface `theme` / `sourceApp`, and
  host events (`OnBeginRenderingSurface` / `OnDeleteSurface` / `OnUserAction`).
- **Component-handler registry** — each component type maps to a handler; the standard
  catalog is the set registered at construction, and a **custom catalog is extra handlers
  registered onto the same renderer** via `RegisterComponent` — no renderer subclass.
- **Distributable** — installs a static library, public headers, and a `pkg-config` file.
- **Deterministic, regression-tested rendering** held to a pixel-level screenshot suite.

### Added

- **Host & integration**
  - `A2uiHost` facade with multi-surface support, per-surface `theme` (`width`, `height`,
    `pattern`), `sourceApp`, and `sendDataModel`.
  - `JsonFeed` accepts a JSON array of messages, newline-delimited JSONL, or a single
    object; `JsonFeedFile` renders a whole file as one batch (deferred render).
  - Install rules + `a2ui-dali.pc` `pkg-config` so the library is consumable from another
    build with `pkg-config --cflags --libs a2ui-dali`.
- **Catalog** — Text, Image (responsive; `avatar` → circular mask), Icon (tintable
  Material set), Divider, Row/Column (`FlexLayout`), List (templated via data path), Card,
  Tabs, Button, TextField, CheckBox, ChoicePicker, Slider, ProgressBar, DateTimeInput,
  Modal, and view-composition skeletons for Video and AudioPlayer.
- **Custom catalogs** — `A2uiRenderer::RegisterComponent(type, handler)` public API and a
  `RenderContext` that gives a custom handler the same services the built-ins use (data
  binding via `ResolveString` / `ResolveFloat` / `GetBoundPath`, the action dispatcher,
  and `RenderChild(id)` to recurse). See `examples/custom-component/`.
- **Examples** — `basic-renderer`, `gallery-demo` (keyboard catalog browser),
  `custom-component` (registers a `Badge` type), `a2a-integration`, and ready-to-run v0.9
  sample streams under `examples/samples/`.
- **Tooling** — a screenshot capture harness (`tools/capture.sh`) and a pixel regression
  runner (`tools/regress.sh`) that diffs the gallery examples against a golden baseline.

### Architecture

- The renderer dispatches each component through a **registry** (`ComponentRegistry`),
  with one file per component under `src/renderer/components/`; `a2ui-renderer.cpp` holds
  only the dispatch, entry point, and shared helpers (385 lines). Shared state is passed
  explicitly through `RenderContext`.
- A2UI catalogs are a **negotiated set of component types**, not a code artifact. The
  registry *is* the catalog: the standard catalog is the built-in handler set, and a custom
  `catalogId` needs no special-casing because the renderer renders whatever types are
  registered. This matches the official A2UI renderers (Lit / Angular / React).

### Theming

- Colours resolve through OneUI semantic tokens (`A2uiTheme`) with a bundled palette
  fallback; the standard catalog renders on a white card surface with rounded image corners
  by default, sourced from the theme rather than hard-coded per component.
- Image sizes, font sizes, radii, borders, and spacing are centralised in `A2uiMetrics` and
  expressed in density-independent `dp` units for clean high-DPI scaling.

### Verification

- **Conformance**: 68/68 parser/model assertions pass (`a2ui-conformance-test`).
- **Screenshot regression**: 29/29 gallery examples render pixel-identical to the golden
  baseline (`tools/regress.sh`); renders are deterministic, so any non-zero mean-abs-diff
  flags a regression.
- **Clean build**: builds from scratch with zero warnings/errors against the DALi revision
  below.

### Known limitations

- A trailing inline item of small text inside a flex-grow row (e.g. a duration or price at
  the far end of a row) can clip, because DALi flex-grow does not reserve width for a
  trailing sibling. Tracked for a follow-up.
- Video and AudioPlayer are view-composition skeletons (poster/art + transport affordance),
  not real media playback.

### Compatibility

- Built against `dali2-core` / `dali2-adaptor` **2.5.24** (`devel/master`) and the current
  `dali-ui` `devel` typed-visual API (`Ui::VisualType`, `Ui::ImageView`, by-value signal
  slots). `dali-ui` UI/visual APIs change frequently; track a `dali-ui` revision from the
  same period. Source `setenv` from your `dali-env` before building.
